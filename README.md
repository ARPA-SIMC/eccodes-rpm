This github repository neither hosts nor provide ecCodes sources, it's meant to
host convenience files for backporting recent versions to CentOs 8 (derived from
official fedora eccodes package: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/eccodes)

ecCodes is a package developed by ECMWF which provides an application
programming interface and a set of tools for decoding and encoding messages in
GRIB e BUFR formats. For more info see:
